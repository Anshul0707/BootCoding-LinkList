### Linked List

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes that together represent a sequence.

### Consider the above example
- node A is the head of the list.
- node D is the tail of the list.
- Each node is connected in such a way that node A is pointing to node B which in turn pointing to node C.
- Node C is again pointing to node D. 
- Node D is pointing to null as it is the last node of the list.
